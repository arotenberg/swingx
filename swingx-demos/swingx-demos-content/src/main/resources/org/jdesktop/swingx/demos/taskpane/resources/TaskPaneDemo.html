    	JXTaskPane is a container designed to display tasks and information.  
    	Modern application often provide context-sensitive information or 
    	actions based on the current selection.  JXTaskPane replicates that 
    	functionality.
    	<p>
    	Although JXTaskPane can be placed in any container, it is most often 
    	placed within a JXTaskPaneContainer (as it is here).  
    	JXTaskPaneContainer is specifically designed to display multiple 
    	JXTaskPanes in a platform-appropriate manner.
    	<p>
    	Note: the demo application uses JXTaskPanes in the demo selector to
    	group the demos by category.
