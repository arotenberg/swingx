      JXMultiSplitPane is a container that can be split into multiple resizeable
      areas. The layout is configured using MultiSplitLayout layout manager.
      <p>
      The MultiSplitLayout layout manager recursively arranges its components in
      row and column groups called "Splits". Elements of the layout are
      separated by gaps called "Dividers". The overall layout is defined with a
      simple tree model whose nodes are instances of MultiSplitLayout.Split,
      MultiSplitLayout. Divider, and MultiSplitLayout.Leaf. Named Leaf nodes
      represent the space allocated to a component that was added with a
      constraint that matches the Leaf's name. Extra space is distributed among
      row/column siblings according to their 0.0 to 1.0 weight. If no weights
      are specified then the last sibling always gets all of the extra space,
      or space reduction.
      <p>
      Although MultiSplitLayout can be used with any Container, it's the default
      layout manager for JXMultiSplitPane. JXMultiSplitPane supports
      interactively dragging the Dividers, accessibility, and other features
      associated with split panes.
