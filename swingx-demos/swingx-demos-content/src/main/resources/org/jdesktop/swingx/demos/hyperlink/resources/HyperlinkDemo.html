		JXHyperlink component is a button which by default looks like a classic 
		HTML link element. For most simple usage, it can be configured with a 
		URI which internally is visited by using the appropriate Desktop method.
		<p>
		Rendering of "active" Hyperlinks is supported for all SwingX 
		collection components, if enabled. It includes rollover effects and link visiting 
		on mouse-clicks and space.
