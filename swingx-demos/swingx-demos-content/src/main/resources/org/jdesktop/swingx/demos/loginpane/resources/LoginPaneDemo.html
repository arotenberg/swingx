		JXLoginPane is a control that provides a standard login screen for an 
		application.  It allows the use to pick different servers to log into, 
		save user names, passwords, or both, and allows the developer to create
		any login service necessary.  The LoginService can be as secure as
		necessary and can use whatever mechanisms for communication the 
		developer needs.
