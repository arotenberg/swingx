<strong> java.net project has been moved over to Kenai infrastructure. As 
a consequence SwingLabs and subs have seemingly empty download dirs - nevertheless, 
all old stuff is there, for a bare-bones view goto 
<a href="http://java.net/downloads/swingx/"> http://java.net/downloads/swingx/ </a> 
(replace the actual project name for any of the others). Note: most links in the

   <p> Welcome to SwingLabs SwingX! </p> 
</div>
 
<div id="swinglabs-description">
		 <p> Contains extensions to the Swing GUI toolkit, including new and enhanced
      components that provide functionality commonly required by rich 
      client applications.  Highlights include:
			</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sorting, filtering, highlighting for tables, trees, and lists</li>
        <li>Find/search</li>
        <li>Auto-completion</li>
        <li>Login/authentication framework</li>
        <li>TreeTable component</li>
        <li>Collapsible panel component</li>
        <li>Date picker component</li>
        <li>Tip-of-the-Day component</li>
      </ul>
			<p>
      Many of these features will eventually be incorporated into the Swing
      toolkit, although API compatibility will not be guaranteed.
The SwingX project focuses exclusively on the
    raw components themselves.</p>

<p>
A webstartable demo of several components (work-in-progress, 
code is available in the <a href="http://swinglabs-demos.java.net/">swinglabs-demos subproject</a>):

    <p><strong>Important note:</strong> SwingX 1.0 was the <strong>last</strong> release targeted at 
		Java 5 (JDK 1.5, "Tiger"). Since release SwingX 1.6, the codebase is moved to target <strong>Java 6</strong> 
		(JDK 1.6, "Mustang").
    We are open to having maintenance of a SwingX 1.0 (JDK 1.5 compatible) as a branch on our SVN repo;
    	we don't have ourselves the resources to 
    commit to this - if you have the time and interest, please contact us on the 
    <a href="https://swinglabs.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectForumView" title="SwingLabs discussion forum">SwingLabs discussion forum</a>.

<h3>How to... </h3>

		<p class="question"> ... get the most current code? </p>
    <p class="answer"> Check out from svn or grab recent weekly or release build results from the 
    Documents/Files section. We do 
    <a href="http://swinglabs.java.sun.com/hudson/">continous integration</a> with Hudson
    on an external server which occasionally (haha) is down. If available, they come in 
		two variants: a weekly version created every Sunday and a current version created
		after every commit to the codebase. There's also a <a 
		href="http://parabuild.viewtier.com:8080/parabuild/index.htm?view=dashboard">
		Backup Continuous Integration</a>  (will be back soon) provided by <a
		href="http://www.viewtier.com">Parabuild Server</a>.
		</p>
    
		<p class="question"> ... get the most current developer and user documentation? </p> 
    <p class="answer"> Check out the
    <a href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Javadesktop/SwingLabsSwingX">SwingLabs Wiki</a> page. 
		(will be there, sometime :-)

		<p class="question"> ... ask questions and get answers? </p> 
    <p class="answer"> Post to the shared
